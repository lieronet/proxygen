    This website creates playtest cards for use in the Magic: the Gathering trading card game. It is powered by the Scryfall API.
    This is a fan project that is unaffiliated with either Wizards of the Coast or the good people at Scryfall.
    If you have any issues, please create an issue on the project's <a href="https://www.github.com/lieronet/proxygen">Github</a>.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
